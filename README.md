# CIFAR-10 Image Classification using CNN

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset using TensorFlow and Keras. The project covers data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## 📁 Dataset

[CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) is a collection of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is divided into:

- **50,000 training images**
- **10,000 test images**

## 🚀 Features

- TensorFlow/Keras-based model
- CNN architecture for image classification
- Train/test split, normalization, and one-hot encoding
- Model training with performance visualization
- Accuracy and loss graphs for training and validation
